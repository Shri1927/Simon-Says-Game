# Simon-Says-Game
Simon Says is a classic children's game that promotes listening skills and physical activity. In the game, one player, designated as "Simon," gives commands that the other players must follow only if the command begins with the phrase "Simon says." If a player follows a command that does not start with this phrase, they are out of the game.
